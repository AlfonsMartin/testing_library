OXID eShop Testing Library
==========================

The OXID eShop testing library can be used to test OXID eShop with existing or new Unit, Integration, Mink or QUnit tests. Furthermore, it can also be very helpful to developers who create a module for the OXID eShop.

Currently the library contains code from the [OXID eShop repository](https://github.com/OXID-eSales/oxideshop_ce/tree/b-dev-ce/tests). However, the code will be removed from the shop's repository soon.

Also, documentation is still work in progress, and will be updated soon. If you have questions regarding this testing library, feel free drop us a line in the [dev-general mailing list](http://wiki.oxidforge.org/Mailinglists).
